# Analyzing Customer Churn in Power BI

## Analysis Goal

Analyze customer churn data to understand why customers are leaving and identify strategies to reduce churn rates for Databel, a fictitious Telecom company.

## Understanding Churn
Churn is a term used to describe the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company. Understanding churn is crucial because it directly impacts a company's growth and profitability.

Here's why it's important:

Losing customers is expensive: It costs more to acquire new customers than to retain existing ones.
Churn impacts revenue: Losing customers means losing revenue, which can negatively impact a company's bottom line.
Churn reveals problems: High churn rates can indicate issues with products, services, pricing, or customer service, all of which need to be addressed.

By understanding churn, companies can take steps to reduce it and improve customer loyalty, ultimately leading to greater success.

## Data Check
Created two measures (Number of Customers and Number of Unique Customers) to check if the count of customer IDs is equal to the count of unique customer IDs. To prevent double-counting costs, in case there are duplicate rows. Both measures came out as = 6687
